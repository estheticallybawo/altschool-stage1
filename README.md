# AltSchool Software Engineering Program - Month 1

## Project: Personal Web Page

This repository contains my AltSchool assessment for Month 1, in which I built two simple Projects,
1, A web page displaying my basic information, AltSchool ID, biography, reasons for joining the program, and 
goals for the School of Engineering program.
2, A two-page web with no CSS,  the first is going to be a table about all the courses and schools existing at AltSchool Africa, 
The Second page is a page where you use all the media elements existing in HTML to create a powerful message about myself.

## Features
- Displays personal details, biography, and program-related goals.
- Implements a fragment identifier to scroll back to the top of the page.
- Built using only HTML (no CSS or JavaScript).
